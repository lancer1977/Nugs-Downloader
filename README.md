|videoFormat|Video download format. 1 = 480p, 2 = 720p, 3 = 1080p, 4 = 1440p, 5 = 4K / best available. **FFmpeg needed, see below.**
|outPath|Where to download to. Path will be made if it doesn't already exist.
|token|Token to auth with Apple and Google accounts ([how to get token](https://github.com/Sorrow446/Nugs-Downloader/blob/main/token.md)). Ignore if you're using a regular account.
|useFfmpegEnvVar|true = call FFmpeg from environment variable, false = call from script dir.

**FFmpeg is needed for TS -> MP4 losslessly for videos & HLS-only tracks, see below.**  

# FFmpeg Setup
[Windows (gpl)](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)    
Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`    
Termux `pkg install ffmpeg`    
Place in Nugs DL's script/binary directory if using FFmpeg binary.

If you don't have root in Linux, you can have Nugs DL look for the binary in the same dir by setting the `useFfmpegEnvVar` option to false.
